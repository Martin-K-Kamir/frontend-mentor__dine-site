![preview of the site](preview.jpg)

This is a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). Coded by [me](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/Martin-K-Kamir)! üòÅ

Welcome to the repository for this project. Feel free to look around and explore! üòÄ

### Tools

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/)

### Development
I switched from CRA to Vite, which seems a better option for this project. I liked how easy its to use postcss plugins with vite and build processes on production.
In this project, I learned cool tricks with react, which made the code more DRY. For CSS I used my SCSS-generated utilities, which speed up the development and also made the code cleaner because I have been using the same utility classes over and over.
The downside of it the classes in HTML are harder to read. that's why I used the CUBE methodology to make the HTML classes more organized and better readable. After all, I am very happy with how I coded this project. Many times I am not happy at the end of how I coded the project. So i can pat myself.
